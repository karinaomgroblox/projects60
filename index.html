        <p id="info"> My hobbies include many- yoga, dance, coding, cricket, etc. But my personal favourite is swimming. I love swimming more than anything else. I love it so much that I even plan to enroll for amateur tournaments. I have been swimming for ten years now. I still remember the day when I first went to the pool. I was against myself, I did not want to plunge into the devilish water, and the same waters have turned angelic now. My mother and father, regular members of the swimming club, forced me to water, without any floaters, and asked me to cycle. Frantically I spun my legs and after two days, to my surprise, I saw that I could float. I was so happy that day. Then gradually, my parents coached me in all other forms of swimming- freestyle, butterfly, breast stroke, back stroke and diving. After I learnt swimming, I always wanted to be in the pool. What seemed difficult to my parents in the beginning was getting me into the pool and now what is difficult is getting me out.</p>

        <h5>Watson is an inspiration for that alone: she has managed to juggle fame and the real world and keep them in balance.

Image result for emma watson belleSince Hermione, Watson has appeared as many strong female characters, most recently as Belle in Beauty in the Beast. One of the reasons why Watson is adamant about empowering women on-screen, is because she is a feminist activist off-screen. In 2014, Watson was appointed as a UN Women Goodwill ambassador. She helped launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, which calls for men to advocate gender equality. We love her for this! As a role model to many young women and men, we believe that our society will listen to what she has to say about equality. An example of her activism is how she brought Marai Larasi, an activist in her own right on the issue of violence against women, as a guest to the Golden Globe Awards this year. The passion, determination and eloquence through which Watson fights for what she believes in, is an inspiration.</h5>
